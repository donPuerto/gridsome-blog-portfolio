### What is Adonis js?

<br />

AdonisJs is a Node.js MVC framework that runs on all operating systems. It offers a stable eco-system to write a server-side web application so that you can focus on business needs over finalizing which package to choose or not.

AdonisJs favours developer joy with consistent and expressive API to build a full-stack web application or a micro API server.
