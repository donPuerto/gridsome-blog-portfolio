### What is the purpose of this tutorial?

<br />

Well, this is for my personal consumption. Basically it is a note that focus on step by step process. Also, learning a program its not like you only to learn one language, you need to learn it all. It's hard and boring, but what can i do, this is my bread and butter, so need to get going and i dont want to get left behind.
