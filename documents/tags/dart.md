### What is Dart?

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript.

Dart is an object-oriented language with C-style syntax which can optionally trans compile into JavaScript. It supports a varied range of programming aids like interfaces, classes, collections, generics, and optional typing.

Dart can be extensively used to create single-page applications. Single-page applications apply only to websites and web applications. Single-page applications enable navigation between different screens of the website without loading a different webpage in the browser. A classic example is GMail ─ when you click on a message in your inbox, browser stays on the same webpage, but JavaScript code hides the inbox and brings the message body on screen.

Google has released a special build of Chromium – the Dart VM. Using Dartium means you don’t have to compile your code to JavaScript until you’re ready to test on other browsers.
